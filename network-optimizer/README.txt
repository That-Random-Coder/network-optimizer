Build in Code::Blocks:
1. Create new Console Application (C).
2. Add all files in src/ to the project.
3. Set project working directory to the project root.
4. Build the project.
5. To run with sample input: open a command prompt in project root and run:
   netopt.exe sample_inputs\sample_graph.txt < sample_inputs\sample_graph_input.txt

See run_experiments.bat for automated experiment runs (requires gen_graph.exe and netopt.exe built).
